* lisp like php (llp)

** What is llp
   `llp` stands for lisp like php.
   It's a collection of small classes that allows one to write "lisp like" syntax in php.
   `lisp like` means that the final code looks like lisp but with "a lot of" restrictions. :)

** Note:
   This version is currently in it's very early alpha stage and may never be finished!!!

*** Restrictions:
    1. You can't write functions with just plain parentheses.
       In lisp `(+ 1 2)` would add the numbers 1 and 2. 
       Because this is not valid in php the `l` function was introduced.

       So in llp you need to write:
       `l('+', 1, 2);`

    2. As you see in the first example you must quote the operator, `+` in this case.
       Php does not allow you to you just pass `+` operator.

    3. Currently you can not define custom functions in llp.

** Examples   
*** simple stuff
    1. sum of numbers
       l("+", 1, 2, 3); // => 6
    2. more math
       l('+', l('/', 4, 2), 2, 1); // => 5
    3. define a variable
       l('def', 'x', 3);
    4. write multiple statements
       l('progn',
         l('def', 'x', 3), // define x as 3
         l('def', 'x', l('+', 'x', 2)),// overwrite x with sum of x + 2 
         l('def', 'x', l('*', 2, 'x')),// overwrite x with x^2
         l('-', 'x'); //and finally return -x, which will be -10
       )
    5. write to output
       l('print', "Hello World!")

*** "complex" example 
    What do you think the following code will output ?
    `l(
     'progn',
     l(
	 'def',
	 'result',
	 l(
	     'if',
	     l(
		 "!",
		 l(">", 10, 5)
	     ),
	     l('+', 2, 3),
	     l('-', l('*', 10, 10))
	 )
     ),
     l('print', 'result')
    );`
    Correct, the result will be -100.
